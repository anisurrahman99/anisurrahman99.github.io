                    California is truly one of the world’s biggest markets for legal cannabis. In 2018, there were $3.7 billion in retail cannabis sales. By 2020, it’s expected to grow to $5.2
                    billion. California is easily one of the world’s biggest
                    cannabis markets: not only is it a massive state with a huge population, but both medical and recreational pot are legal there. And TransCanna is right there on the ground floor in Modesto, ready to ship cannabis to major dispensaries right next store.

                <p>TransCanna has been busy acquiring companies to build up its revenue base before production. One of its most recent acquisitions was GoodFellas Inc., a marijuana
                marketing agency based in California. The agency is
                already bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in revenue, so TransCanna will be making sales before its marijuana grow sites become operational.</p>

                  <h3>Other cannabis stocks are being bought out at premium prices, providing quick money for their investors.</h3>
                  <p>The marijuana industry has been witness to a flurry of
                    acquisitions that have made early investors wealthy. In 2018, about 35% of Canopy Growth Corp’s shares were purchased by the beverage giant Constellation Brands for over $5 billion. And that’s just the biggest among many acquisitions that have taken place in the marijuana sector over the past year. Many smaller, hundred
                    million dollar acquisitions have closed, with early
                    investors having been enriched after their shares were bought out at premium prices. Should the same thing happen to TransCanna, investors who bought at today’s prices will be rewarded handsomely.</p>

                <p>Last but not least, there’s the fact that TransCanna already has enough production space to become a major cannabis distributor. 190,000 square feet puts the
                company within striking distance of big players like Canopy and Aurora. With that much space, TransCanna could grow and sell millions of dollars worth of pot every year. And as its sales grow, its investors will be the main beneficiaries.</p>
